# Mc_Gyver

""" This is a game about the real life of a super hero called Mac Gyver. It was the first crafter of all time. 
Think of it, he was able to turn single components with no value into a super weapon to beat his ennemies.

Yeah, truly he was bad... But now, it is your turn to play as a hero!
We give you the chance to live a 'normal day in the life of Mac Gyver' and it is for free!!

So, for the scheme, you're were trapped in a giant lab, you're alone and don't have any weapon.
You have to find your way throw the lab, collect items disseminated inside it and then go find the guardian.
As his name should say it, the guardian guards the exit of the lab. It is the key for the victory!

But be carefull, the guardian is really naughty. He will show no mercy to Mac Gyver.

If you want to win, you will have to use the items collected to make a super mega weapon to use against the
villain!
That's the conditions of victory!

Now seriously, for the game:
- you move with the arrow keys (up for up, left for left, ...)
- and that's all!

Good luck!

Note:
It's Python style inside, working with 3.7 in virtualenv with Pygame
See the requirements for more!
